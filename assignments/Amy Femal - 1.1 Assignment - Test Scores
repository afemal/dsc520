scores <- read.csv(file = 'data/scores.csv')
str(scores)

## 1. What are the observational units in this study?
  
## 2. Identify the variables mentioned in the narrative paragraph and determine which are categorical and quantitative?

    ## The count and score variables are quantitative and the section variable is categorical.

## 3. Create one variable to hold a subset of your data set that contains only the Regular Section and one variable 
   ## for the Sports Section.

reg <- subset(scores, Section == 'Regular') 
sport <- subset(scores, Section == 'Sports')

## 4. Use the Plot function to plot each Sections scores and the number of students achieving that score. Use additional 
  ##  Plot Arguments to label the graph and give each axis an appropriate label. Once you have produced your Plots answer
  ##  the following questions:
regCount <- reg$Count
regScore <- reg$Score
sportCount <- sport$Count
sportScore <- sport$Score
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(regScore, regCount, main = 'Regular Section', ylab = 'Count', xlab = 'Score')
plot(sportScore, sportCount, main = 'Sports Section', ylab = 'Count', xlab = 'Score')
max(reg$Score)
max(sport$Score)
summary(reg$Score)
summary(sport$Score)
## a. Comparing and contrasting the point distributions between the two section, looking at both tendency and consistency:
  ##  Can you say that one section tended to score more points than the other? Justify and explain your answer.

  ## Looking at the plots, it appears there the Sports section had the maximum score. However, students in the regular section
  ## seemed to score more points that the sports section.

## b. Did every student in one section score more points than every student in the other section? If not, explain what a 
  ##  statistical tendency means in this context.

 ## No, not all students in the regular section score more than those in the sports section. In fact, the highest
 ## score was in the sports section. Statistical tendency is the mean????

## c. What could be one additional variable that was not mentioned in the narrative that could be influencing the point 
  ##  distributions between the two sections?

## An additional variable could be whether or not the student had a interest in sports. If a student is 
## not interesting in the topic, it could cause disinterest in the content of the class. This may cause
## poor performance. ????
